Pipeline that allows for comparisons between behavior types-- for Random Motorized Treadmill project. Is run AFTER pipeline_fluorescence_analysis (so, once correlations & PCs have been calculated & separated, here you start averaging things by behavior). 

Functions are called from pipeline_functional_comparisons.m. 

This code depends on code in code_common_to_pipelines repository. 

This code calls on code created by other programmers. Credit belongs to the original creators of each part of this code, and should be cited accordingly.

This respository is a work in progress. For questions, problems, or concerns, please email Sarah West at west0883@umn.edu.
